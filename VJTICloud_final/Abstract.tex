Cloud Computing allows the user to access the cloud services dynamically over the internet wherever and whenever needed. Cloud is majorly divided into three types private cloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud. This thesis discusses about implementing a private cloud using open source cloud software and operating system. This private cloud is capable of providing the infrastructure and platform as a service. Infrastructure as a service includes the compute, storage and network services and platform as a service includes the operating system, middleware and runtime environment. The private cloud implementation is done using OpenStack (kilo) and Ubuntu server 14.04.
